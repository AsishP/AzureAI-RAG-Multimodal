The layout features two main circular gauges on the left and right sides, with a central display area.\n\n1. **Left Gauge**: The left circular gauge is an RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge, which measures engine speed. It has a scale ranging from 0 to 7 (with an additional mark for 8) indicating thousands of RPMs. There are warning lights and indicators above and below this gauge.\n\n2. **Right Gauge**: The right circular gauge is a speedometer, which measures vehicle speed. It is marked in kilometers per hour (km/h), with a range from 0 up to 240 km/h. Like the left gauge, it has warning indicators situated above and below it.\n\n3. **Central Display**: In the middle of the instrument cluster is a rectangular display that appears to have no information visible in this image. This area could be used for a variety of features, such as digital speed readouts, navigation information, or vehicle alerts.\n\n4. **Additional Indicators**: Along the top and sides of the instrument cluster, there are various icons and symbols representing additional vehicle functions, such as lights, warnings, and other important information.\n\nThe overall design is sleek and modern, using a gray color scheme that gives it a contemporary feel. The clarity of the gauges and indicators helps drivers quickly gather the necessary information while driving."

However, in some cases\nthe signal coming to your vehicle may\nnot be strong and clear.\nThis can be due to factors, such as\nthe distance from the radio station,\ncloseness of other strong radio sta-\ntions or the presence of buildings,\nbridges or other large obstructions in\nthe area.\nAM broadcasts can be received at\ngreater distances than FM broad-\ncasts. This is because AM radio\nwaves are transmitted at low fre-\nquencies. These long distance, low\nfrequency radio waves can follow the\ncurvature of the earth rather than\ntravelling straight.

Because\nof this, FM broadcasts generally\nbegin to fade within short distances\nfrom the station. Also, FM signals are\neasily affected by buildings, moun-\ntains, and obstructions.This can lead\nto undesirable or unpleasant  listen-\ning conditions which might lead you\nto believe a problem exists with your\nradio. The following conditions are\nnormal and do not indicate radio\ntrouble:\n\u2022 Fading - As your vehicle moves\naway from the radio station, the sig-\nnal will weaken and sound will\nbegin to fade. When this occurs, we\nsuggest that you select another\nstronger station.\n\u2022 Flutter/Static - Weak FM signals or\nlarge obstructions between the\ntransmitter and your radio can dis-\nturb the signal causing static or flut-\ntering noises to occur. Reducing the\ntreble level may lessen this effect\nuntil the disturbance clears.\n\u2022 Station Swapping - As an FM signal\nweakens, another more powerful\nsignal near the same frequency\nmay begin to play. This is because\nyour radio is designed to lock onto\nthe clearest signal. If this occurs,\nselect another station with a\nstronger signal.\n\u2022 Multi-Path Cancellation - Radio sig-\nnals being received from several\ndirections can cause distortion or\nfluttering. This can be caused by a\ndirect and reflected signal from the\nsame station, or by signals from two\nstations with close frequencies. If\nthis occurs, select another station\nuntil the",

The central part of the steering wheel prominently displays the Hyundai logo. Surrounding the logo, there are multiple buttons likely used for controlling various functions, such as audio, phone, and cruise control.\n\nThe wheel itself has a two-tone appearance, with a matte gray finish on the central section and slightly glossy accents. The grips of the wheel are rounded and have a textured feel, making it comfortable for drivers to hold. The design suggests a focus on both functionality and style, typical of contemporary vehicle interiors. The overall presentation is sleek and tailored, appealing to users who value both aesthetics and practicality in their driving experience."
